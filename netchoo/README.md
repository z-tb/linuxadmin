# Netchoo

A real-time network traffic monitoring application written using Python, GTK3 and Claudeâœ¨ (mostly Claude), providing visual representation of network interface activity. 

Here we can see Netchoo in action as it downloads a tarball from kernel.org, then uploads it to an s3 bucket for no other reason than to generate a nice graph.
